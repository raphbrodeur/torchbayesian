torchbayesian is a lightweight [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) extension that lets you turn any PyTorch model into a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) with just one line of code.
It makes [Bayes-by-Backprop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424) and variational inference effortless and compatible with any `nn.Module`, without you having to rewrite your model using custom layers or change your usual PyTorch workflow.
Its goal is to make uncertainty-aware and Bayesian deep learning as easy as working with any traditional neural network.

### One line to make any torch model into a BNN
